- **Monte Carlo Study and Image Reconstruction of a prototype SPECT using GAGG scintillators for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy**
  - *2024.10 - Now*
  - Division of Sustainable Energy and Environmental Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University / Toyota Radiation Research Institute
  - Description: In boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), the real-time measurement of local boron dose is required. To address this problem, the measurement of 478 keV prompt gamma-rays from boron neutron capture reactions has been proposed. Recently, A prototype BNCT-SPECT using GAGG scintillators has been fabricated. Thus, we are conducting Monte Carlo study and image reconstruction specialized for this prototype BNCT-SPECT, before performing experimental evaluation using therapeutic neutron beam.

- **Establishment of a Novel Compton Camera for Dosimetry Application in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy**
  - *2024.04 - Now*
  - Division of Sustainable Energy and Environmental Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University
  - Description: In boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), it is necessary to know the difficult-to-determine boron concentration and neutron fluence for in-vivo dose evaluation. To address this problem, the measurement of 478 keV prompt gamma-rays from boron neutron capture reactions has been proposed. Compton cameras utilize incident gamma-rays which are Compton scattered in a scatterer detector followed by their photoelectric absorption by an absorber detector. Thus, we are developing a novel compton camera that can measure the 478 keV prompt gamma-rays precisely in high intensity neutron irradiation field for clinical BNCT.

- **Conceptual Design of a Compact Static Gantry System with Multi-angle Irradiation for Carbon-ion Radiotherapy**
  - *2024.05 - 2024.10*
  - Accelerator Research Division, Research Center for Nuclear Physics, Osaka University
  - Description: Due to the high magnetic rigidity of carbon ions, transporting therapeutic carbon-ion beams with high angular flexibility is more challenging than with lighter ions, such as protons. Recently, irradiation of carbon ions with flexible angular selections has been achieved through rotating gantry systems, but these require large mechanical frames to house a series of beam transport elements for rotation around the treatment couch. A static beam delivery system compatible with multiple irradiation angles is a promising alternative to the rotating gantry system, offering potential for miniaturization and cost reduction of carbon-ion radiotherapy facilities. This study proposes a compact static gantry system concept, using electromagnets arranged in a circular configuration around the treatment couch to enable multiple angular irradiations of therapeutic carbon-ion beams.

- **Development of Real-time Absolute Epi-thermal Neutron Flux Intensity Monitor for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy**
  - *2021.10 - 2024.03*
  - Division of Sustainable Energy and Environmental Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University
  - Description: In boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), epi-thermal neutron irradiation is carried out to treat deep-seated cancers, as epi-thermal neutrons can be slowed down in a human body and converted into thermal neutrons before reaching the tumor. Since the number of irradiated epi-thermal neutrons determines the therapeutic effect, it is significantly required to measure the epi-thermal neutron intensity during the irradiation. Thus, we have been developing a novel monitor to measure the absolute epi-thermal neutron flux intensity on the body surface of a patient in real-time during BNCT treatment.

- **Automated CT-based Modeling for the Localization and Characterization of Obstruction in Small Bowel Obstruction**
  - *2020.08 - 2021.06*
  - School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Sydney
  - Description: Small bowel obstruction is an abdominal disorder diagnosed using CT imaging. Image-based diagnosis is a complex task requiring a clinician to navigate through a stack of 2D slices representing the tortuous 3D small bowel. Our goal is to simplify this task by segmenting the bowel and generating high quality 3D models. 3D deep neural networks have the potential to perform segmentation efficiently and accurately. This research project focuses on investigating efficient ways to generate labelled segmentation data and developing a deep learning model based on 3D convolutional neural network to perform volumetric segmentation of small bowel from CT data.
